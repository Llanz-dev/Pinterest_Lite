What is Pinterest?
    Pinterest is a social media platform that allows users to discover, save and share images and videos related to various topics, such as fashion, food, home decor, and more. The platform is based on a visual discovery concept, where users can browse through images or videos called "pins" and save them to virtual collections known as "boards".

    Pinterest has a search feature that allows users to find specific content related to their interests. Users can also follow other users or boards and share pins on other social media platforms.
